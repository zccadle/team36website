		<ul class="info_list">
			<li>
				<span class="icon"></span>
				<div class="cont">
					<h4 class="title">User Interface/User Experience</h4>
					<div class="desc">The user interface of our project is meticulously crafted, presenting a clean and polished design. Despite encountering only two minor bugs, which occur under rare usage conditions and were not observed during normal user testing, our team has remained receptive to feedback from clients. While the UI has evolved significantly from its initial sketches, feedback from our target audience indicates satisfaction with the current design. However, to further enhance our application, we acknowledge the benefit of hosting the React app to allow users from diverse backgrounds to provide feedback and facilitate iterative improvements.</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="icon"></span>
				<div class="cont">
					<h4 class="title">Functionality</h4>
					<div class="desc">Our project's functionality exceeds the initial requirements set by our clients. Initially tasked with making bar and line charts interactive and mobile-friendly, we recognized the importance of interactivity and clarity across various devices. This led to the development of additional features such as the force-directed graph and hierarchical layout graph, which received positive feedback from both users and clients. Additionally, the implementation of the heatmap presented interesting challenges, particularly in converting data from the IFRC GO API into coordinates for ArcGIS visualization. We are confident that our diverse range of graphs offers unique perspectives on data visualization and eagerly anticipate future applications by the Red Cross.</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="icon"></span>
				<div class="cont">
					<h4 class="title">Stability</h4>
					<div class="desc">While the application remains mostly stable, two lingering bugs require attention. Despite thorough manual testing, the possibility of overlooking issues cannot be entirely ruled out. However, we are confident in the robustness of our codebase, built upon sound coding practices and effective teamwork. Limited testing with varying data scales due to constraints of the IFRC GO API may pose challenges, but our reliance on D3.js ensures resilience against diverse datasets.</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="icon"></span>
				<div class="cont">
					<h4 class="title">Efficiency</h4>
					<div class="desc">Efficiency improvements are warranted, particularly concerning the heatmap functionality. Although visually appealing, the ArcGIS library's extended load time presents a performance challenge. Efforts to mitigate this issue through the ESRI Loader were hampered by technical obstacles, necessitating direct utilization of the ArcGIS API. Future optimizations should focus on enhancing load times without compromising visual quality.</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="icon"></span>
				<div class="cont">
					<h4 class="title">Compatibility</h4>
					<div class="desc">Our project demonstrates compatibility with modern browsers and common operating systems, ensuring seamless user experiences across diverse platforms. Extensive testing across multiple systems validates the effectiveness of our automatic resizing features on various devices.</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="icon"></span>
				<div class="cont">
					<h4 class="title">Maintainability</h4>
					<div class="desc">Emphasizing maintainability, our codebase is meticulously documented, facilitating ease of understanding and modification for future development. Detailed documentation on the Bar Chart Component serves as a valuable resource for users seeking to customize chart functionalities. Furthermore, comprehensive comments within individual components enhance readability and accessibility for all users.</div>
				</div>
			</li>
			<li>
				<span class="icon"></span>
				<div class="cont">
					<h4 class="title">Project Management</h4>
					<div class="desc">Our project management approach was characterized by transparency and regular communication with the client. Weekly progress updates and bi-weekly code showcases ensured alignment with client requirements and facilitated timely adjustments to project milestones. This proactive approach enabled swift and efficient execution, ensuring adherence to project timelines and client expectations.</div>

<section class="container my-5 mx-auto">
    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Future Work</h2>
    <p>Moving forward, there are several avenues for future work that can further enhance the project's impact and functionality. One compelling opportunity is to transition away from the existing PowerBI dashboard utilized by IFRC GO and focus on seamlessly integrating our custom charts into the IFRC GO Dashboards using iframes. This integration would streamline data visualization workflows and provide users with a cohesive and interactive experience within the existing IFRC GO platform. Additionally, with the successful fulfillment of all MoSCoW requirements, there is scope to explore the development of interactive polar charts and other chart types that were not prioritized during the initial phase. By expanding the range of available visualizations, we can offer users even more powerful tools for data analysis and decision-making.</p>
